Summer 2022
This is Java Final Project.

The requirement for completion is to incorporate at least 3 "advanced concepts" learned in class.

For this project, I created a Typing Speed Test - as it's name implies, it measures how many words a user can type per minute.
This project implemented UI, network communication between a client and a server, and a database where results can be stored and retrieved.
Refer to wiki for final report.
